# SimpleAgentCodex

This repository contains a minimal Node.js application that serves a static HTML page.

## Requirements

- Node.js 14+
- npm

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Opening this URL in your browser displays a simple page from `static/index.html`.


```bash
npm run local
```

This starts `local.js` which serves the files in the `static` directory.
